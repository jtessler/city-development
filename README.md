City Development
================

A web-based 3D city modeling system intended for a high school geometry project.

The Plan and Expected Results
-----------------------------

Students are required to explore area calculations for various polygons
(buildings), tessellation, population density, and other environmental science
issues. This system provides a web-based platform for students to explore the
world they create. Therefore, I expect to use WebGL.


Using a bird’s-eye view, students will place various structures, e.g. schools,
houses, power plants, represented as polygons about a 2D grid. For each
building, students may specify the number of floors and, potentially, aesthetic
qualities. Furthermore, initial geography and structure placements are randomly
generated, so no two projects are alike. Every change immediately updates a 3D-
rendered version, where students may “fly around” and inspect the modifications.

The Learning Potential
----------------------

Using WebGL provides an opportunity to implement a number of discussed class
topics in a completely new environment. As time allows, I can explore the
“procedural architecture and cities” suggestion on the webpage for the
aforementioned randomized component.  Given the cross-disciplinary nature of
this project, I also have a chance to learn more about lesson plan design and
incorporating technology in the classroom. Lastly, I expect to improve my
interface design skills, knowing my audience will be high school students.
